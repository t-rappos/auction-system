## Tracking Software
### Trello

### Github Issues

- Is integrated with trello
- Integration with travis-ci

### Github Pull requests

- Can run tests before commit to master

### Jira
### Bugzilla
## Continuous Integration / Deployment

- needs test driven development

### Jenkins-CI
- steep learning curve

### Travis-CI
- simpler
- nodeJS - NPM for dependancy management
- make sure code coverage is tested as well
-
"The correct process is to write your new code on a branch. Push to that branch. Create a pull request in github. Then only merge to master if the Travis build passes."

## Testing
- write tests
- only write code to ensure that the current tests pass
- code coverage - write tests to run program through all branches
  - blanket.js
  - istanbul
  - codecov.io
- javascript - JSHint - static analysis
- QUnit - javascript unit testing framework
- nodeJS - uses Gulp?
